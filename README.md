# CS373

My code for the assigned projects of CS187, a course that introduces fundamental concepts of 2D and 3D computer graphics, such as image processing, 2D/3D modelling, 3D graphics pipeline, WebGL, shading, texture mapping and ray tracing. Project overviews taken from the instructions provided by the professo are provided below.

_Note that the majority of code that I have written would be under the TODO sections of each project, though there are helper methods and classes that are not under the TODOs._

## Warmup

This project is a quick introduction to computer graphics programming using Javascript, WebGL, and three.js. Through this homework, you will ensure WebGL runs correctly in your browser and experiment with some basic features of a provided demo program.

_TODO sections in glWarmup.js; one written question, adding two additional shapes to the program (TorusKnot and TorusKnot2 mesh), modifying the code to be able to rotate objects horizontally._

## Image Processing

In this project, you will implement several image processing algorithms, including pixel operations, convolution, dithering, and mosaicing. 

_TODO sections in imProcess.js; implement functions adjustContrast, adjustSaturation, sharpen, uniformQuantization, randomDither, orderedDither, imageMosaic._

## Curves

In this project, you will implement algorithms to compute Bezier, B-Spline, and Hermite curves. The starter code can then generate and render surfaces of revolution using the curves you compute.

_TODO sections in curves.js; implement functions Beizier, BSpline, Hermite, use your implementation to generate two novel surfaces of revolution of your own design._

## Subdivision

In this project, you will implement Loopâ€™s subdivision algorithm to generate subdivided surfaces.

_TODO sections in subdivision.js; implement function subdivide._
