# CS373

My code for the assigned projects of CS187, a course that introduces fundamental concepts of 2D and 3D computer graphics, such as image processing, 2D/3D modelling, 3D graphics pipeline, WebGL, shading, texture mapping and ray tracing. Project overviews taken from the instructions provided by the professo are provided below.

_Note that the majority of code that I have written would be under the TODO sections of each project, though there are helper methods and classes that are not under the TODOs._
