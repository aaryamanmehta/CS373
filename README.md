# CS373

My code for the assigned projects of CS187, a course that introduces fundamental concepts of 2D and 3D computer graphics, such as image processing, 2D/3D modelling, 3D graphics pipeline, WebGL, shading, texture mapping and ray tracing. Project overviews taken from the instructions provided by the professo are provided below.

_Note that the majority of code that I have written would be under the TODO sections of each project, though there are helper methods and classes that are not under the TODOs._

## Warmup

This project is a quick introduction to computer graphics programming using Javascript, WebGL, and three.js. Through this homework, you will ensure WebGL runs correctly in your browser and experiment with some basic features of a provided demo program.

_TODO sections in glWarmup.js; one written question, adding two additional shapes to the program (TorusKnot and TorusKnot2 mesh), modifying the code to be able to rotate objects horizontally.

## Image Processing
